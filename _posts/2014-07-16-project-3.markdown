alt: PrivacyTracker provides user-centered data about trackers
description: Other Chrome extensions that claim to help you block online trackers merely show you generic information about companies that was pulled straight out of a huge database. They don't tell you why it all matters to <i>you</i>. PrivacyTracker is different. It shows you all the things that a tracking company knows about <i>you</i> and what they'll do with the information. If you want them to continue spying on you, let them be, and if you don't, hit the giant switch to block them! It's really that simple. With PrivacyTracker, all you have to do is decide if you want x company to know a, b, c about you. While other tools make you look up each company that's tracking you, PrivacyTracker personalizes the entire experience to you.
