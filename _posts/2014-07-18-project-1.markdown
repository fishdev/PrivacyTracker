description: PrivacyTracker is a user-centered browser plugin to help you understand online tracking. It provides an intuitive interface to easily understand how your data is being collected by third parties across the Internet and allows you to quickly block companies that you don't want to share your data with. While existing privacy tools only provide unintelligible, generic information, PrivacyTracker personalizes information about tracking based on your browsing activity.
