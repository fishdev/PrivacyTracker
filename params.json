{"name":"PrivacyTracker","tagline":"A user-centered browser plugin to understand online tracking","body":"<p>PrivacyTracker is a user-centered browser plugin to help you understand online tracking. It provides an intuitive interface to easily understand how your data is being collected by third parties across the Internet and allows you to quickly block companies that you don't want to share your data with. While existing privacy tools only provide unintelligible, generic information, PrivacyTracker personalizes information about tracking based on your browsing activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"how-it-works\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-it-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>How It Works</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you visit a website, there are a bunch of companies you've never heard of that collect information about you. This data is often used to show you ads based on your interests and sell your data to advertisers. Most people don't like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PrivacyTracker lets you quickly and easily prevent companies from collecting your personal information. It explains who's tracking you, when they've tracked you before, and what they know about you. If you don't want them to collect your data, you can simply hit a button and PrivacyTracker will block them completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"features\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#features\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Features</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>easy-to-use, hassle-free interface</li>\r\n<li>simple explanations of the online tracking ecosystem</li>\r\n<li>convenient toggle for third-party tracking companies</li>\r\n<li>personalized information about when trackers have collected your data in the past and what they know about you</li>\r\n<li>streamlined configuration options</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"installation\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#installation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Installation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PrivacyTracker works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
